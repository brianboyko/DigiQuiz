## Sub-Heading ##
  > A framework for educational gamification, collaborative teaching, and educational data visualization. 

## Summary ##

  DigiQuiz is an engine and framework for education gamification. Starting with the simple question-and-answer format of a trivia game show (much like Jeopardy), DigiQuiz creates games which can be controlled from a central dashboard by the teacher, and allow any student to play on their laptops, tablets, phones, or other Internet enabled device.  

## Problem ##
  > Using the "game show" format to make learning fun is a teaching staple, but at best, only one student can be engaged at one time.  While these formats are effective, it would be better to engage all students. Additionally, some students may dislike the competitive nature of these games and actively turn off. 

## Solution ##
  > DigiQuiz allows any teacher to create a game. At that time, a unique code (part of the URL) is generated and can be written on the blackboard or displayed onscreen. Students then enter that code and get directed to the correct game.  Students will have access to questions and a way to input answers, and the teacher controls the game from the front of the room.  Furthermore, the responsive design allows teachers to use mobile devices, which means they do not have to be chained to the desk.  

## Quote from You ##
  > "From our own high-school days playing Jeopardy-like games with our teachers before major tests, we know that student engatement is paramount in the learning process. We are working to make student learning more effective and productive"

## How to Get Started ##
  > To get started, simply browse to [URL] and create an account or login. You'll be directed to a dashboard where you can create a new game and see data on your students' performances. To play, students just got to [URL] as well and enter in a 4-character code - questions will appear on their devices where they can buzz in (or enter, in text, their answers).  

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Even the shyest student in the class's eyes light up when we use TREBEC to review for the PSATs - it allows her to participate in every lesson we have.  My students have shown a 30% improvement in scores since we started using it, and I'm actually looking forward to when they take the PSAT!"
