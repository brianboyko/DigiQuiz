There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > TREBEC - Teachers' Responsive Evaluator for Basic Educational Criteria (Preliminary Name)

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A framework for educational gamification, collaborative teaching, and educational data visualization. 

## Summary ##
  > There are a number of problems teachers have these days. How do you keep kids engaged and learning? How can you easily tell which students need additional instruction, or where the class as a whole could use review, without subjecting your students to a battery of tests?  How can you track your teaching performance over time?  And how can you tell if your students are ready for the multitude of standardized exams, whether that's the SAT, New York State's Regents exam, or the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR)?  

  TREBEC is an engine and framework for education gamification. Starting with the simple question-and-answer format of a trivia game show (much like Jeopardy), TREBEC creates games which can be controlled from a central dashboard by the teacher, and allow any student to play on their laptops, tablets, phones, or other Internet enabled device.  

## Problem ##
  > Using the "game show" format to make learning fun is a teaching staple, but at best, only one student can be engaged at one time.  While these formats are effective, it would be better to engage all students. Additionally, some students may dislike the competitive nature of these games and actively turn off. 

## Solution ##
  > TREBEC allows any teacher to create a game. At that time, a unique code (part of the URL) is generated and can be written on the blackboard or displayed onscreen. Students then enter that code and get directed to the correct game.  Students will have access to questions and a way to input answers, and the teacher controls the game from the front of the room.  Furthermore, the responsive design allows teachers to use mobile devices, which means they do not have to be chained to the desk.  

## Quote from You ##
  > "From our own high-school days playing Jeopardy-like games with our teachers before major tests, we know that student engatement is paramount in the learning process. We are working to make student learning more effective and productive"

## How to Get Started ##
  > To get started, simply browse to [URL] and create an account or login. You'll be directed to a dashboard where you can create a new game and see data on your students' performances. To play, students just got to [URL] as well and enter in a 4-character code - questions will appear on their devices where they can buzz in (or enter, in text, their answers).  

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Even the shyest student in the class's eyes light up when we use TREBEC to review for the PSATs - it allows her to participate in every lesson we have.  My students have shown a 30% improvement in scores since we started using it, and I'm actually looking forward to when they take the PSAT!"
