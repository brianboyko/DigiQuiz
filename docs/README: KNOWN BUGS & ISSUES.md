README: KNOWN BUGS & ISSUES

## Dashboard:
 * Hitting "Delete Deck" deletes the deckID from the Users list of decks, but not from the view or from the "decks" collection in the database. 
 * On creating a new deck, new deck does not show up in view (though it is created in the database - reload is required)
 * Editing a different deck requires reloading the page.
